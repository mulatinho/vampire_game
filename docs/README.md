# Example Plot

## Plot

The game happens on a modern City in a epoch before the mass surveillance, where people still could do things without be seeing by  a camera, this does not means that there were no vigilance systems only that it was not so common on the epoch and their costs were high.

Even if the city was modern, it was not a national metropolitan city with lots of people on the streets, also it was not a low size city; With a population number reaching the average of 500.000 people the city could receive somewhat big events and still see people walking alone on some streets.

## Game

- **City Name**:  Malta
